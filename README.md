Our group project is aimed to create the **Industry Project Placement System** which manages the industry placements for students. The system can manage both industries and students. It can also allocate a project to each student based on the nature of the project and the student’s skill sets.

Three types of users are involved, specifically, ***student, Industry Mentors, and Staff in-charge of the industry project***, with different access levels to a range of functions in the system. Logging in to the system with an email address and the resetting password option are available for all types of users. 

:student: -**Students** can create, view and update their profiles, change the password, create a wish list of preferred projects, update the project preferences and personal statements, and view the status of the placement and a whole list of available companies. 

:technologist: -**Industry Mentors** can view and update the company’s profile and the project’s description, select and add skills required, view students’ information, edit mentor’s contact details, select a list of preferred students, and have a shortcut button on the page to contact Lincoln University Staff in-charge.

:teacher: -**Staff in-charge** of the industry project can create Industry Mentor’s Login and password, view students’ and companies’ profiles, view and update placement status, generate placement status reports and a matching process for companies to select from a list of 3 to 5 students. 

This system can enable Student to upload their CV, Mentors and Staff in-charge to download Student’s CV, and Mentors and Staff in-charge to contact each other by filling out the email form on the page that is linked to the appropriate email address. 

Filters and the search function will be applied to different users to select their wanted results such as available placements and companies, enrolled students, preferred candidates, required skills and technologies, and placement status.

Python, Flask, MySQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript will be used.
